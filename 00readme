This directory contains an example thesis using the
LaTeX document preparation system. Within the sample
is a simple guide to using LaTeX. It is based on the
sample 3rd year report, but uses the style
appropriate for a postgraduate thesis.

Start by looking at the file report.tex.

To process the report example:

Copy all the files.
Run
   latex report
   bibtex report
and then run `latex report' twice more.
