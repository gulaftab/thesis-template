The aim of the thesis is to investigate the performance of Gismos and
to design and construct a super multi-functional Gismo.

The novel aspects of the new Gismo are described. The abstract should
perhaps be about half a page long.

The results of testing, which show the abject failure of the Gismo,
are presented.

In the conclusions proposals for rectifying the deficiences are
outlined.
