Thesis-template
===============

This is the latex template for my PhD thesis based on the School of Computer Science, University of Manchester thesis Style class file. The original source can be downloaded from  http://csis.cs.manchester.ac.uk/software/contrib/latex/MUThesis/. I'll be tweaking, making changes for my own liking and if you find those changes useful feel free to use them and If you have something cool/useful to share, send me a pull request please.
